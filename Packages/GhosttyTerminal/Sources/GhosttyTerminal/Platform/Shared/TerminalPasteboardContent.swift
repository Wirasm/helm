/// What a paste hands the terminal, read off the general pasteboard the way
/// Ghostty's macOS app reads it: files as shell-escaped paths, text as-is.
///
/// Two readers, deliberately kept apart:
///
/// - ``text(from:)`` is what ghostty's `read_clipboard` callback uses. It
///   serves the paste binding *and* a program's OSC 52 read, so it has no
///   side effects and never touches the disk.
/// - ``files(from:completion:)`` (UIKit) is for a host-driven paste when the
///   pasteboard holds raw image or document data with no path at all — a
///   screenshot, a photo, a file copied out of Files. That data is staged as
///   a file first (``TerminalFileStaging``) so the paste lands as a path a
///   program can open; a program asking for "the clipboard" must never
///   trigger that write.
