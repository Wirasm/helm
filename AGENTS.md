# AGENTS.md — helm

Native macOS surface: SwiftUI + GhosttyKit. A terminal as the permanent centre, workspaces
above it, a right dock for an open artifact. **No backend** — artifacts are files.

**"Agent" means a CLI agent already in use — Claude Code, pi, codex.** helm hosts one in a
terminal it owns and renders what it writes. It never builds or hosts an agent of its own.

Direction: `docs/direction.md` (an entry point, not a spec).

## Working here

Gate, all green before a PR to `development`:

```
bash scripts/patch-libghostty.sh && swift build && swift test && make lint && xcodegen generate
```

The patch script is first and not optional — the patched libghostty is gitignored, so a
fresh worktree has nothing to link against. Never borrow another checkout's `vendor/`;
that proves the other checkout builds.

- **Never restart a running helm without warning the operator** — a live window may be
  hosting their session.
- **Never delete a test to make the gate green.** If its subject genuinely no longer
  exists, say which and why in the commit.
- **You may or may not be able to see the UI — test, don't assume.** Screen Recording is a
  TCC grant on the *invoking context*, not on agents as a category: some contexts have it,
  none can grant it to themselves. The test is `swift tools/winshot.swift helm <out.png>`,
  which exits nonzero when the grant is missing. `--list` needs no grant at all and
  separates a real window from a crash, a zero-sized one or an off-screen one — but says
  nothing about what is drawn. The accessibility tree is a dead end either way: helm's
  centre is a Metal-layer NSView with no child elements to enumerate (verified against a
  known-good build). A capture shows you pixels, not correctness — never report a surface
  as verified on appearance alone without the operator.
- **`winshot` matches owner names by substring**, so a second helm instance — a worktree
  build, say — is indistinguishable from the operator's. Check `--list` for how many are
  running before trusting a capture.
- `swift run helm` to iterate, `make app` for the real bundle.
- Conventional commits, written as a human — no AI attribution.

## Architecture — how to think about where code goes

**Vertical slices by feature, not layers.** `Sources/Helm/<Feature>/` holds that feature's
model, views and commands together. If a thing can name a single feature, it belongs in that
feature's directory — including its keyboard shortcuts and notification handling. Only work
that genuinely spans features stays in `App/`, which is composition and nothing else. The
test is simple: two people building two features should not have to edit the same file.

**Put a command handler where its lifetime is right, not where it looks tidy.** A subscription
that has to work while its view is closed belongs on the model, which outlives the
presentation. Attaching it to the view means it is dead in exactly the state it exists for.

**Prefer values over live objects at a seam.** Describe what a thing is with a small `Codable`
value and resolve it to the live object at the edge. Persistence, restore and equality then
come free, where a tree of protocol existentials would need a hand-rolled type registry.

**Let Swift's access control tell you where the seam is.** `@Published private(set)` state is
only mutable from the type's own file, so an extension that has to mutate it is not a seam —
it is the same module wearing two filenames. Fighting that with looser access or wrapper
methods usually means the split was wrong.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

GitHub issues on `Wirasm/helm`, via `gh`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context; vocabulary is canonical in `CONTEXT.md`, with `../GLOSSARY.md` for the
cross-repo terms helm shares with kild and prp. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
